The asm on cpu is effective.

The first iteration takes about 10 times longer than the rest.
I am guessing this is a compulsory cache miss.

All of the functions are in the same ball park.
Also, I should read the integers on demand, not all at once.
Reading all at once is giving me segfaults.

Best Practices:

Asses: Determine if the program is parallizable.

Parallelize: Expose the parallelism in the code.

Optimize: Optimize on many levels.

Deploy: Compare outcome.

Minimizing memory movement is key.

S =  ---------------
                 P
      (1-P) +  ----
                N
